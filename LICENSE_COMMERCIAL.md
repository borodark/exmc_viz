Copyright (c) 2026 Igor Ostaptchenko, Octanix Americas LLC.
All rights reserved.

This Commercial License governs use of ExmcViz and any Enterprise modules
explicitly designated by the Licensor. By installing, copying, or using the
Software, you agree to these terms.

1. Definitions
--------------
“Software” means ExmcViz and any Enterprise modules explicitly designated by
Licensor.

“Licensee” means the individual or entity using the Software.
“Production Use” means use in a live system serving users, customers, or
internal business operations.
“Hosted Service” means making the Software available to third parties over a
network as a service (SaaS, PaaS, managed service, API service, or similar).

2. License Grant
----------------
Subject to payment of fees (if any) and continuous compliance with these terms,
Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
revocable license to:

- install and use the Software for internal business purposes, and
- deploy the Software in Production Use environments.

2A. OEM Embedding Grant
-----------------------
Licensee may embed the Software into a Licensee product (“OEM Product”) for
distribution to Licensee’s end customers, provided that:

- Licensee’s end customers do not receive source code to the Software.
- The Software is used solely as an internal component of the OEM Product.
- Licensee remains responsible for all compliance obligations under this
  agreement.

2B. Per-Node License Scope
--------------------------
The Software may be installed and executed only on the number of nodes covered
by the license (“Licensed Nodes”). A “node” is a physical or virtual machine,
container host, or VM instance where the Software runs.

- Each distinct machine/VM/instance counts as one node.
- Container replicas on the same host count as one node unless they run on
  separate hosts or VMs.
- Auto-scaling that increases the number of active nodes must be licensed prior
  to exceeding Licensed Nodes.

3. Restrictions
---------------
Licensee may not:
- redistribute, sublicense, or resell the Software or derivatives;
- publish the Software or make it available as open source;
- remove or alter copyright notices or license terms;
- use the Software to build a competing commercial product;
- offer the Software as a Hosted Service to any third party without a separate
  written agreement from Licensor.

3A. OEM Distribution Restrictions
---------------------------------
Licensee may not:
- enable or market the Software as a standalone feature or product;
- expose the Software as a Hosted Service to third parties unless expressly
  licensed in writing;
- remove or obscure Licensor’s notices embedded in the Software.

3B. Compliance and Audit
------------------------
Licensee must maintain reasonable records of node counts and deployments and,
upon written request no more than once per year, provide a self-certification of
compliance with Licensed Nodes.

4. Ownership
------------
The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor retains all rights, title, and
interest in the Software and all derivatives.

5. Confidentiality
------------------
If the Software is provided in source form or includes proprietary
documentation, Licensee agrees to treat it as confidential and to protect it
using reasonable measures.

6. Support and Updates
----------------------
Support, updates, and maintenance are provided only if explicitly included in a
separate written agreement.

7. Warranty Disclaimer
----------------------
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

8. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------
IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF DATA OR PROFITS, ARISING FROM USE OF THE
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY.

9. Term and Termination
-----------------------
This license remains in effect until terminated. Licensor may terminate
immediately if Licensee breaches any term. Upon termination, Licensee must
cease all use and destroy all copies of the Software.

10. Governing Law

This agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Licensor is
located, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
